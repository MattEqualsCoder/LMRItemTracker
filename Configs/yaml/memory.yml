# Config file for tracker responding to specific memory changes. This is a dictionary of memory addresses and different
# responses to different memory values.

# Fields
# ------
# Key (string): Unique internal tracker name for items. Used for merging the same item between different config files. Do not modify.
# Value (string): The new value detected in memory
# PreviousValue (string, optional): The previous value detected in memory
# SayOnce (True/False): If the line should only be said the first time it comes up
# FilterMemoryLocation (string, optional)
# FilterMemoryValue (string, optional): If both FilterMemoryLocation and FilterMemoryValue are both set, tracker will
#     only say this response if the other memory location specified in FilterMemoryLocation has the value of 
#     FilterMemoryValue
# Responses (weighted possibilities): Tracker's responses when detecting the memory change
# ResponsesOnRepeat (weighted possibilities, optional): Tracker's responses when detecting the memory change for a second time


# Example
#   byte-197:
#    - Key: gyonin
#      Value: 1
#      PreviousValue: 0
#      SayOnce: False
#      FilterMemoryLocation: byte-196
#      FilterMemoryValue: 1
